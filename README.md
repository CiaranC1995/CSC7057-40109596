This is my submission for CSC7057: Individual Software Development Project. I have built a binary classifier that predicts whether a given piece of text is AI-generated or human-written. The classifier is deployed within a user-friendly, intuitive web application for ease of use, with added account holder functonality included for users who wish to sign up.
