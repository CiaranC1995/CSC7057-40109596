# CSC7057-40109596
Implementation of CSC7057 Individual Software Development Project

The aim of my project is to create a software solution that can accurately analyse and classify an input text as being either written by a human or generated by AI. This will be done in Python, using the Flask framework to make it into a web application. This README will be updated as more progress is made.
