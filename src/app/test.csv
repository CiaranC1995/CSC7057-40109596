1,"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.

""Up! Get up! Now!""

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

""Up!"" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

""Are you up yet?"" she demanded.

""Nearly,"" said Harry.

""Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.""

Harry groaned.

""What did you say?"" his aunt snapped through the door.

""Nothing, nothing . . .""

Dudley's birthday - how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

""In the car crash when your parents died,"" she had said. ""And don't ask questions.""

Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

""Comb your hair!"" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.",0
2,"Robert Langdon awoke slowly.

A telephone was ringing in the darkness--a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.

Where the hell am I?

The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram:

HOTEL RITZ PARIS.

Slowly, the fog began to lift.

Langdon picked up the receiver. ""Hello?""

""Monsieur Langdon?"" a man's voice said. ""I hope I have not awoken you?""

Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the dead.

""This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it is urgent.""

Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.

THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS
proudly presents
An evening with Robert Langdon
Professor of Religious Symbology, Harvard University

Langdon groaned. Tonight's lecture--a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of Chartres Cathedral--had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely, some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.

""I'm sorry,"" Langdon said, ""but I'm very tired and--""

""Mais monsieur,"" the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. ""Your guest is an important man.""

Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon's visibility had increased a hundred-fold after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self-important historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.

""If you would be so kind,"" Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, ""could you take the man's name and number, and tell him I'll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you."" He hung up before the concierge could protest.

Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted: SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ.

He turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him was a stranger--tousled and weary.

You need a vacation, Robert.

The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.

If Boston Magazine could see me now.

Last month, much to Langdon's embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that city's top ten most intriguing people--a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt him at the lecture he had given.

""Ladies and gentlemen . . ."" the hostess had announced to a full-house at The American University of Paris's Pavillon Dauphine, ""Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The Art of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you use his textbooks in class.""",0
3,"In the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in a shroud. ""Her Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed.""

""I would be only a small disturbance, ser."" Tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve. ""I bear a letter from my father, Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King. There is his seal.""

""Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed,"" Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion were a dullard who had not heard him the first time.

Jaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard--excepting himself, always--because his face gave no hint as what he might do next. Tyrion would have welcomed a hint. Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords, but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of Joffrey's protectors. Yet if he let the man turn him away, where was his authority? He made himself smile. ""Ser Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who was captain of Lord Arryn's household guard?""

""I know the man."" Ser Mandon's eyes were pale grey, oddly flat and lifeless.

""Knew,"" Bronn corrected with a thin smile.

Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that.

""Be that as it may,"" Tyrion said lightly, ""I truly must see my sister and present my letter, ser. If you would be so kind as to open the door for us?""

The white knight did not respond. Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his way past when Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside. ""You may enter. They may not.""

A small victory, he thought, but sweet. He had passed his first test. Tyrion Lannister shouldered through the door, feeling almost tall. Five members of the king's small council broke off their discussion suddenly. ""You,"" his sister Cersei said in a tone that was equal parts disbelief and distaste.

""I can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies."" Tyrion paused to admire the pair of Valyrian sphinxes that guarded the door, affecting an air of casual confidence. Cersei could smell weakness the way a dog smells fear.

""What are you doing here?"" His sister's lovely green eyes studied him without the least hint of affection.

""Delivering a letter from our lord father."" He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled parchment between them.

The eunuch Varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands. ""How kind of Lord Tywin. And his sealing wax is such a lovely shade of gold."" Varys gave the seal a close inspection. ""It gives every appearance of being genuine.""

""Of course it's genuine."" Cersei snatched it out of his hands. She broke the wax and unrolled the parchment.

Tyrion watched her read. His sister had taken the king's seat for herself--he gathered Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had--so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand's chair. It seemed only appropriate.

""This is absurd,"" the queen said at last. ""My lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this council. He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as he himself can join us.""

Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously. ""It would seem that a welcome is in order.""

""Indeed."" Jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself. ""We have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this grim omen in the sky, rioting in the city streets . . .""

""And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?"" Cersei lashed out. ""Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle.""",0
4,"On a very hot day in August of 1994, my wife told me she was going down to the Derry Rite Aid to pick up a refill on her sinus medicine prescription -- this is stuff you can buy over the counter these days, I believe. I'd finished my writing for the day and offered to pick it up for her. She said thanks, but she wanted to get a piece of fish at the supermarket next door anyway; two birds with one stone and all of that. She blew a kiss at me off the palm of her hand and went out. The next time I saw her, she was on TV. That's how you identify the dead here in Derry -- no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the walls and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out of a chilly drawer on casters; you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope.

The Rite Aid and the Shopwell are less than a mile from our house, in a little neighborhood strip mall which also supports a video store, a used-book store named Spread It Around (they do a very brisk business in my old paperbacks), a Radio Shack, and a Fast Foto. It's on Up-Mile Hill, at the intersection of Witcham and Jackson.

She parked in front of Blockbuster Video, went into the drugstore, and did business with Mr. Joe Wyzer, who was the druggist in those days; he has since moved on to the Rite Aid in Bangor. At the checkout she picked up one of those little chocolates with marshmallow inside, this one in the shape of a mouse. I found it later, in her purse. I unwrapped it and ate it myself, sitting at the kitchen table with the contents of her red handbag spread out in front of me, and it was like taking Communion. When it was gone except for the taste of chocolate on my tongue and in my throat, I burst into tears. I sat there in the litter of her Kleenex and makeup and keys and half-finished rolls of Certs and cried with my hands over my eyes, the way a kid cries.

The sinus inhaler was in a Rite Aid bag. It had cost twelve dollars and eighteen cents. There was something else in the bag, too -- an item which had cost twenty-two-fifty. I looked at this other item for a long time, seeing it but not understanding it. I was surprised, maybe even stunned, but the idea that Johanna Arlen Noonan might have been leading another life, one I knew nothing about, never crossed my mind. Not then.

Jo left the register, walked out into the bright, hammering sun again, swapping her regular glasses for her prescription sunglasses as she did, and just as she stepped from beneath the drugstore's slight overhang (I am imagining a little here, I suppose, crossing over into the country of the novelist a little, but not by much; only by inches, and you can trust me on that), there was that shrewish howl of locked tires on pavement that means there's going to be either an accident or a very close call.

This time it happened -- the sort of accident which happened at that stupid X-shaped intersection at least once a week, it seemed. A 1989 Toyota was pulling out of the shopping-center parking lot and turning left onto Jackson Street. Behind the wheel was Mrs. Esther Easterling of Barrett's Orchards. She was accompanied by her friend Mrs. Irene Deorsey, also of Barrett's Orchards, who had shopped the video store without finding anything she wanted to rent. Too much violence, Irene said. Both women were cigarette widows.

Esther could hardly have missed the orange Public Works dump truck coming down the hill; although she denied this to the police, to the newspaper, and to me when I talked to her some two months later, I think it likely that she just forgot to look. As my own mother (another cigarette widow) used to say, ""The two most common ailments of the elderly are arthritis and forgetfulness. They can be held responsible for neither.""

Driving the Public Works truck was William Fraker, of Old Cape. Mr. Fraker was thirty-eight years old on the day of my wife's death, driving with his shirt off and thinking how badly he wanted a cool shower and a cold beer, not necessarily in that order. He and three other men had spent eight hours putting down asphalt patch out on the Harris Avenue Extension near the airport, a hot job on a hot day, and Bill Fraker said yeah, he might have been going a little too fast -- maybe forty in a thirty-mile-an-hour zone. He was eager to get back to the garage, sign off on the truck, and get behind the wheel of his own F-150, which had air conditioning. Also, the dump truck's brakes, while good enough to pass inspection, were a long way from tip-top condition. Fraker hit them as soon as he saw the Toyota pull out in front of him (he hit his horn, as well), but it was too late. He heard screaming tires -- his own, and Esther's as she belatedly realized her danger -- and saw her face for just a moment.",0
5,"Once upon a time, in a vast and wondrous universe, there existed a small blue planet called Earth. On 
this planet, humans marveled at the twinkling stars that adorned the night sky and dreamed of exploring the mysteries 
of space.

In a modest suburban neighborhood, young Emma gazed at the stars every night from her backyard. She was captivated by 
the endless possibilities that lay beyond Earth's atmosphere. Emma's room was filled with books about galaxies, 
spaceships, and the wonders of the universe. Her imagination soared as she envisioned herself floating among the stars.

One day, as Emma was reading about the latest discoveries in space, she came across an advertisement for a unique 
opportunity—a chance to participate in an intergalactic adventure. It was a competition organized by a renowned space 
agency, seeking a young explorer to join their crew and embark on a journey to explore uncharted territories in the 
far reaches of the universe.

Emma's heart raced with excitement. She knew this was her chance to fulfill her lifelong dream of venturing into 
space. With determination, she submitted an application and poured her heart into the accompanying essay, describing 
her unwavering passion for the cosmos.

Weeks passed, and Emma's anticipation grew. Then, one fateful afternoon, she received a letter bearing the space 
agency's emblem. Trembling with excitement, she tore open the envelope, her eyes scanning the words: 
""Congratulations, Emma! You have been selected as the young explorer for our intergalactic mission.""

Emma could hardly contain her joy. She hugged her parents tightly, their eyes filled with pride. She spent the 
following weeks undergoing rigorous training, preparing her mind and body for the extraordinary challenges that 
awaited her in the great expanse of space.

Finally, the day of departure arrived. Emma, now suited up in her astronaut gear, stepped into the spacecraft. She 
looked out the window and bid farewell to her family, knowing that she was about to embark on a journey that would 
change her life forever.

As the spacecraft soared into the endless depths of space, Emma marveled at the celestial wonders that unfolded 
before her eyes. She witnessed nebulas bursting with vibrant colors, swirling galaxies stretching across the cosmos, 
and the breathtaking beauty of distant planets.

During her mission, Emma and her fellow astronauts encountered intelligent alien civilizations, each with its unique 
customs and ways of life. They shared knowledge, experiences, and formed deep bonds across the vastness of space.

Years passed, and Emma became an inspiration to aspiring young explorers back on Earth. Her remarkable journey and 
discoveries opened the doors to new possibilities for humanity, igniting a passion for space exploration among 
generations to come.

Finally, it was time for Emma to return home. As the spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere, she experienced a mix 
of emotions—gratitude, awe, and a sense of accomplishment. She had become part of something far greater than herself, 
leaving an indelible mark on the history of human exploration.

Emma's feet touched the familiar ground of Earth once again, but she was forever transformed by her journey through 
the stars. She knew that the wonders of space would continue to beckon future generations, inspiring them to reach 
for the stars, just as she had done.

And so, the tale of Emma, the young explorer who traversed the cosmos, would forever serve as a reminder of the 
boundless human spirit and our insatiable desire to unravel the mysteries of the universe.",1
6,"Agile software development is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that 
emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and delivering value in short increments. It focuses on the following key 
principles:

Customer Satisfaction: Agile places a high priority on customer satisfaction by continuously delivering valuable 
software that meets customer needs. Regular customer involvement and feedback are encouraged throughout the 
development process.

Iterative and Incremental Development: Agile promotes breaking down the software development process into smaller 
iterations or timeboxed increments called sprints. Each sprint delivers a working product increment, allowing for 
continuous improvement and feedback.

Adaptive Planning: Agile acknowledges that requirements and priorities can change over time. It emphasizes 
adaptability by allowing for changes and adjustments to be incorporated throughout the project, ensuring that the 
development efforts align with the evolving needs of the project stakeholders.

Embracing Change: Agile recognizes change as an opportunity. It encourages embracing change requirements, even in the 
late stages of development, to provide the greatest value to customers. Changes are welcomed, and the development 
process is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate them.

Cross-functional Collaboration: Agile emphasizes close collaboration and effective communication between team 
members, including developers, testers, product owners, and customers. Regular interactions and face-to-face 
conversations are valued to foster better understanding, shared ownership, and collective decision-making.

Self-organizing Teams: Agile promotes the concept of self-organizing teams. Team members collaborate to determine how 
best to accomplish their work, make decisions collectively, and organize their tasks. This encourages empowerment, 
creativity, and collective accountability.

Continuous Improvement: Agile encourages a culture of continuous improvement. Teams regularly reflect on their work, 
identify areas for improvement, and make adjustments accordingly. Agile methodologies such as Scrum often include 
retrospective meetings at the end of each sprint to facilitate this reflection and learning.

Delivering Working Software: Agile prioritizes delivering working software as early and frequently as possible. Each 
iteration or increment focuses on delivering a potentially shippable product, ensuring that tangible value is 
produced at regular intervals.

Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), embody these principles to varying degrees 
and provide specific frameworks and practices to guide the software development process.

Overall, agile software development promotes collaboration, flexibility, customer focus, and continuous improvement 
to maximize customer value and project success.",1

9,"In Aldous Huxley's novel ""Brave New World,"" Mustapha Mond is portrayed as a powerful and mysterious figure. The novel depicts a dystopian society in which the government, led by Mond, maintains strict control over its citizens through the use of advanced technology and manipulation of emotions. Despite this, I argue that Mond should be viewed positively for three key reasons: his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness, and his belief in individual freedom.

Firstly, Mond's role as World Controller is to maintain stability in society. He recognizes that in order for society to function, there must be a balance between individual desires and the needs of the community. He also understands that in order to maintain this balance, it is necessary to control certain aspects of society, such as the use of technology and the manipulation of emotions. This is evident in his decision to ban literature, which he believes will cause dissent and disrupt the stability of society. In this way, Mond can be seen as a pragmatic leader who is willing to make difficult decisions for the greater good.

Secondly, Mond recognizes the limitations of happiness. In the novel, the government encourages the citizens to pursue pleasure and happiness at all times, but Mond understands that this is not a sustainable or fulfilling way of life. He acknowledges that true happiness cannot be found through constant pleasure and that individuals need to find meaning and purpose in their lives. This is evident in his statement, ""ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches."" This quote shows that Mond recognizes that true happiness cannot be found in constant pleasure, but rather in finding meaning in one's life.

Lastly, Mond believes in individual freedom. Despite his role in controlling society, he recognizes that individuals have the right to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. This is evident in his decision to provide a reservation for those who do not want to conform to the rules of society. This shows that Mond understands that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they choose, even if it means going against the norms of society.

In conclusion, Mustapha Mond, the World Controller in Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" should be viewed positively for his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom. Although his methods are controversial, they are necessary to maintain the balance of society. His recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom also show that he is a nuanced and thoughtful leader who understands the complexity of human nature.",1
