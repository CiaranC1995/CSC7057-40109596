"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.""Up! Get up! Now!""Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.""Up!"" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.His aunt was back outside the door.""Are you up yet?"" she demanded.""Nearly,"" said Harry.""Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.""Harry groaned.""What did you say?"" his aunt snapped through the door.""Nothing, nothing . . .""Dudley's birthday - how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.""In the car crash when your parents died,"" she had said. ""And don't ask questions.""Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.""Comb your hair!"" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.",0

"In Aldous Huxley's novel ""Brave New World,"" Mustapha Mond is portrayed as a powerful and mysterious figure. The novel depicts a dystopian society in which the government, led by Mond, maintains strict control over its citizens through the use of advanced technology and manipulation of emotions. Despite this, I argue that Mond should be viewed positively for three key reasons: his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness, and his belief in individual freedom.Firstly, Mond's role as World Controller is to maintain stability in society. He recognizes that in order for society to function, there must be a balance between individual desires and the needs of the community. He also understands that in order to maintain this balance, it is necessary to control certain aspects of society, such as the use of technology and the manipulation of emotions. This is evident in his decision to ban literature, which he believes will cause dissent and disrupt the stability of society. In this way, Mond can be seen as a pragmatic leader who is willing to make difficult decisions for the greater good.Secondly, Mond recognizes the limitations of happiness. In the novel, the government encourages the citizens to pursue pleasure and happiness at all times, but Mond understands that this is not a sustainable or fulfilling way of life. He acknowledges that true happiness cannot be found through constant pleasure and that individuals need to find meaning and purpose in their lives. This is evident in his statement, ""ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches."" This quote shows that Mond recognizes that true happiness cannot be found in constant pleasure, but rather in finding meaning in one's life.Lastly, Mond believes in individual freedom. Despite his role in controlling society, he recognizes that individuals have the right to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. This is evident in his decision to provide a reservation for those who do not want to conform to the rules of society. This shows that Mond understands that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they choose, even if it means going against the norms of society.In conclusion, Mustapha Mond, the World Controller in Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" should be viewed positively for his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom. Although his methods are controversial, they are necessary to maintain the balance of society. His recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom also show that he is a nuanced and thoughtful leader who understands the complexity of human nature.",1
